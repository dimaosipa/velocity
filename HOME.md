# Velocity üöÄ

The fast, modern package manager for Apple Silicon Macs.

## Why Choose Velocity?

Velocity is a next-generation package manager for macOS, designed for speed, simplicity, and total user control. Velocity treats formulas as declarative files, installs only from pre-built bottles (never compiles from source), and runs entirely in user space‚Äîno sudo, no system writes, and no risk.

## Key Features

- **Apple Silicon Native**: Built from the ground up using Swift for Apple Silicon Macs. No legacy code, no slow emulation.
- **Declarative Formula Handling**: Uses Homebrew .rb formulae as simple, predictable configuration files. No Ruby runtime or interpretation required.
- **Bottle-Only Installs**: Installs exclusively from pre-built bottles. No source compilation, no build dependencies, no waiting.
- **User-Space Operation**: Everything lives in your home directory (default ~/.velo/). Never requires sudo or writes to system directories.
- **Flexible Installation & Caching**: Install Velocity in any directory. Cache packages locally per project, just like `node_modules` for system tools. Perfect for CI, reproducible builds, and isolated environments.
- **Project-Local Dependencies**: Each project can have its own tool versions with velo.json manifests‚Äîlike npm for system packages.
- **Compatible with Homebrew**: Uses existing .rb formulae from Homebrew core tap. Drop-in replacement with zero migration needed.
- **Security-First Design**: SHA256 verification, code signing, and advanced security measures built into every operation.
- **CI Ready**: Built-in GitHub Actions support with automated testing, continuous deployment, and comprehensive CI/CD workflows.

## Performance Features

Velocity is designed for speed at every level of the stack:

- **Swift-Native Formula Parsing**: 10x faster than Ruby interpretation with regex optimization and binary caching.
- **Parallel Downloads**: Multi-stream concurrent downloads with intelligent retry logic and progress reporting.
- **Smart Caching**: Memory + disk layers with automatic invalidation and predictive prefetching.
- **Memory Optimization**: Lazy loading, memory-mapped files, and automatic cleanup for minimal resource usage.
